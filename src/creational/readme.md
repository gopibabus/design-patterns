# Creational Design Patterns

> Creational Patterns provide various Object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### [Factory Method / Virtual Constructor](./factoryMethod/readme.md)
> Provides an interface for creating Objects in a Super Class, but allows subclasses to alter the type of Objects that will be created. 

### [Abstract Factory](./abstractFactory/readme.md)
> Produce families of related Objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### [Builder](./builder/readme.md)
> Helps to construct complex Objects' step by step. The Pattern allows producing different types and representations of an Object using same construction code.

### [Prototype / Clone](./prototype/readme.md)
> Copy existing Objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### [Singleton](./singleton/readme.md)
> Ensure that class has only one instance, while providing global access point to this instance.
