> In this example, the Abstract Factory pattern provides an infrastructure for **creating various types of templates** for different elements of a web page.

> A web application can support different rendering engines at the same time, but only if its classes are independent of the concrete classes of rendering engines. Hence, the application’s objects must communicate with template objects only via their abstract interfaces. Your code shouldn’t create the template objects directly, but delegate their creation to special factory objects. Finally, your code shouldn’t depend on the factory objects either but, instead, should work with them via the abstract factory interface.

> As a result, you will be able to provide the app with the factory object that corresponds to one of the rendering engines. All templates, created in the app, will be created by that factory and their type will match the type of the factory. If you decide to change the rendering engine, you’ll be able to pass a new factory to the client code, without breaking any existing code.
