The Composite pattern can streamline the work with any tree-like recursive structures. The HTML DOM tree is an example of such a structure. For instance, while the various input elements can act as leaves, the complex elements like forms and fieldsets play the role of composites.

Bearing that in mind, you can use the Composite pattern to apply various behaviors to the whole HTML tree in the same way as to its inner elements without coupling your code to concrete classes of the DOM tree. Examples of such behaviors might be rendering the DOM elements, exporting it into various formats, validating its parts, etc.

With the Composite pattern, you don’t need to check whether it’s the simple or complex type of element before executing the behavior. Depending on the element’s type, it either gets executed right away or passed all the way down to all element’s children.
