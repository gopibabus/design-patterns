In this example, the _Page_ hierarchy acts as the **Abstraction**, and the _Renderer_ hierarchy acts as the **Implementation**. Objects of the _Page_ class can assemble web pages of a particular kind using basic elements provided by a _Renderer_ object attached to that page. Since both of the class hierarchies are separate, you can add a new _Renderer_ class without changing any of the _Page_ classes and vice versa.
