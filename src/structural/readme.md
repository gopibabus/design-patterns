# Structural Design patterns

> **Structural Design patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes in to larger structures, while keeping this structures flexible and efficient.

### [Adapter / Wrapper](./adapter/readme.md)
> Provided a unified interface that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### Bridge
> Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into 2 separate hierarchies(abstraction and implementation). Which can be developed independently of each other.

### Composite
> Lets you compose objects into tree structures and work with these structures as if they were individual Objects.

### Decorator
> Lets you attach new behaviors to Objects by placing these Objects inside special wrapper Objects that contain the behaviors.

### Facade
> Provided simplified interface to a library, a framework or any other complex set of classes.

### Flyweight
> Lets you fit more objects into available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple Objects, instead of keeping all the data in each Object.

### Proxy
> Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to original Object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original Object.
